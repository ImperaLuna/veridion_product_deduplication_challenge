These treats are made from natural cow or rabbit skin with fur on, ensuring they are not the same as rawhide, which is a byproduct of the leather industry. The hides are picked up fresh off the table from an abattoir, washed with only soap and water, soaked in a vinegar solution, and then prepped for dehydration. This process takes several days to complete, making the treats ready for your dog to chew. The treats are rich in protein and natural fiber, which aid in digestion and can also help clean your dog's teeth with each chew. They are particularly beneficial for gut microbiome health, intestinal, and anal gland health, and deliver good levels of fiber and manganese. Additionally, these collagen-rich treats are a great addition to worming tablets, although they are not a substitute for them. The sizing recommendations for the cow hides are as follows: for light chewers under 40lbs, the treats range from 5-7"" in length and 60g-80g in weight; for light to medium chewers under 60lbs, the treats range from 7-9"" in length and 100g-140g in weight; for medium chewers under 100lbs, the treats range from 9-11"" in length and 150g-180g in weight; for heavy chewers dogs 100lbs or more, the treats range from 12-14"" in length and 220g-280g in weight. Rabbit pelts are also available, making these treats suitable for any size dog. It is important to supervise your pets closely when giving these treats to ensure proper chewing.

The kit includes all necessary parts to fit and function perfectly with the router.

A small magnet is included in the side of the wrench for easy access and removal of the manhole cover, maintaining dust control. The speed wrench in the kit is similar to the one found in socket sets, allowing for quick adjustments of the bit depth. The wrench includes a spinner handle for easy hand use.
