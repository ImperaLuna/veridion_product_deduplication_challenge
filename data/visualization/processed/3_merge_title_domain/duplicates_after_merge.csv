These treats are made from natural cow or rabbit skin with fur on, ensuring they are not the same as rawhide, which is a byproduct of the leather industry. The hides are picked up fresh off the table from an abattoir, washed with only soap and water, soaked in a vinegar solution, and then prepped for dehydration. This process takes several days to complete, making the treats ready for your dog to chew. The treats are rich in protein and natural fiber, which aid in digestion and can also help clean your dog's teeth with each chew. They are particularly beneficial for gut microbiome health, intestinal, and anal gland health, and deliver good levels of fiber and manganese. Additionally, these collagen-rich treats are a great addition to worming tablets, although they are not a substitute for them. The sizing recommendations for the cow hides are as follows: for light chewers under 40lbs, the treats range from 5-7"" in length and 60g-80g in weight; for light to medium chewers under 60lbs, the treats range from 7-9"" in length and 100g-140g in weight; for medium chewers under 100lbs, the treats range from 9-11"" in length and 150g-180g in weight; for heavy chewers dogs 100lbs or more, the treats range from 12-14"" in length and 220g-280g in weight. Rabbit pelts are also available, making these treats suitable for any size dog. It is important to supervise your pets closely when giving these treats to ensure proper chewing. If this is the first time your dog is getting fur on chews, it is recommended to minimize chewing time to 10-20 minutes and increase it as tolerated.

This two-component adhesive is both flexible and highly conductive, making it ideal for dissimilar materials subjected to vibrations, temperature variations, shock, bending, and mechanical stress. The adhesive is formulated using a proprietary mix of silver and graphene materials, which enhances its flexibility, low electrical resistivity, and durability. The product is non-magnetic and exhibits superior crack resistance due to the graphene fillers. It operates effectively within a temperature range of up to 260°C (500°F) and has a flexible, rubbery texture after curing. The typical applications of this epoxy include electronics operated or exposed to high temperatures, wearable electronics, medical sensors, fiber-optics packaging, and flexible electronics, wiring, and harnesses. The product is available in various sizes, including 30g (20g + 10g), 60g (40g + 20g), and 120g (80g + 40g), and is priced at €85.95. The adhesive is silver in color and has a pot life of 4-6 hours. The mixed viscosity ranges from 270 to 300 Pa·s at 25°C (77°F), and the hardness is less than 90A. The density of Part A is 2.7 to 2.9 g/cm³, and Part B is 3.6 to 3.8 g/cm³.

Tool attachments and accessories,routertechnologies.com,http://routertechnologies.com/index.html,Patented Router Raizer,Router Technologies,,"The Patented Router Raizer is an innovative tool designed to enhance the functionality of plunge routers. Unlike other products that require a special table insert or re-machining the table to fit the insert, the Router Raizer can be used with any standard table or insert ranging from 3/16 to 1/2 inches in thickness. The kit includes all necessary parts to fit and function perfectly with the router. The Router Raizer is installed into the router, replacing the existing height adjustment system, and becomes a part of the router itself, allowing it to work both handheld and in the table. This feature makes it convenient for users with only one router to switch between tasks. For use in a table, a small manhole (dust plug) is installed in the table insert to keep dust and debris out of the drive coupler at the bottom of the router. A small magnet is included in the side of the wrench for easy access and removal of the manhole cover, maintaining dust control. The speed wrench in the kit is similar to the one found in socket sets, allowing for quick adjustments of the bit depth. The wrench includes a spinner handle for easy hand use. The same wrench is compatible with both the top and bottom drive couplers, eliminating the need for extra tools. Router Technologies is also introducing the Xtreme Xtension Professional router bit extension. This extension is designed to work with any 1/2"" router collet, enabling the installation or removal of router bits from above the router table without the need for cumbersome wrenches or spindle locking. It allows for single tool changes, eliminating the need to lock the spindle. The extension can run 1/8"" diameter through 3 1/2"" diameter cutters and features an additional 1 1/4"" length and 1"" deep bore, providing complete support for all 1/2"" and 1/4"" shank bits used with any thickness table or insert plate.
